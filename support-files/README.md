## How to use the load-pmm-dump script

The main goal of the script is to aide in handling importing data coming from a PMM dump export file (or files). The load-pmm-dump script will:

- Create a PMM server container
- Disable the nginx cap for client_max_body_size
- Try to automatically import pmm-dump files
- Provide useful commands and information on how to further use the container

**Note:** the PMM server container will be created without a data volume/container, so this tool is NOT for deploying any other kind of PMM server other than ones holding volatile and temporary data!

## Running the script

There are three ways to run the script (all of them require at least one parameter -- the ticket number or container name string).

- This will assume latest PMM v3 server version, and will deploy one container: `pmm-server-CS0012345`

`load-pmm-dump CS0012345`

- This will use the second argument as PMM server Docker version tag (all other possible arguments are ignored).

`load-pmm-dump CS0012345 3.0.0`

- This will get the PMM server Docker version tag from the .tar.gz/.tgz file metadata, and it will use it for the container. Additionally, it will try to automatically import the data with `pmm-dump import` (optionally, other files can be added as third and following arguments).

`load-pmm-dump CS0012345 /path/to/pmm-dump-1653879141.tar.gz`

After it's done, the tool will output some helpful information and copy/paste-ready commands. For example:
```
## USEFUL INFORMATION AND COMMANDS.

## Port 443 is exported to: 49277

## Use the following for port redirection from your local machine:
ssh -L 8443:127.0.0.1:49277 tp-support03.tp.int.percona.com

## To import a PMM dump:
pmm-dump import --allow-insecure-certs --pmm-url=https://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:49277 --dump-path=[...]

## Use the following to get human readable dates from a Unix timestamp:
date -d @1657948064

## Increase 'Data Retention' in the advanced settings if the samples are older than the default 30 days.
## For example, to increase to 60 days:
## docker exec pmm-server-CS0037806 curl -s -u admin:admin --request PUT -k --url https://127.0.0.1:443/v1/server/settings -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data_retention":"5184000s"}'

## To destroy docker PMM server container:
docker rm -vf pmm-server-CS0037806
```
