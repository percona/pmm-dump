# PMM Dump (pmm-import-export-tool)

PMM Dump is a tool that allows to transfer metrics and QAN data from one PMM Server instance to another. It helps Percona Services engineers troubleshoot issues.

## How to build?

You will need to have Go 1.21+ installed.

In the root directory: `make build`

## Using PMM Dump

The transfer process is split into two main parts: export and import.

In order to run either export or import, you have to specify PMM URL with credentials at least:
```
./pmm-dump export --pmm-url "http://USER:PASS@HOST"
./pmm-dump import --pmm-url "http://USER:PASS@HOST" --dump-path FILENAME.tar.gz
```
Also, you can use credentials flags or envars:
```
./pmm-dump export --pmm-url "http://HOST" --pmm-user USER --pmm-pass PASS
PMM_USER=USER PMM_PASS=PASS ./pmm-dump import --pmm-url "http://HOST" --dump-path FILENAME.tar.gz
```

Here are main commands/flags:

For filtering you could use the following commands (will be improved in the future):

| Command | Flag        | Description                       | Example                      |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| export  | ts-selector | Timeseries selector (for VM only) | `{service_name="mongo"}`     |
| export  | where       | WHERE statement (for CH only)     | `service_name='mongo'`       |
| export  | dashboard   | Dashboard name (for VM only)      | `MongoDB Instances Overview` |
| export  | instance    | Filter by service name            | `mongo`                      |

You could filter by instance using service name or id. For example, we have registered the following mongodb instance:

```
> pmm-admin add mongodb --username=pmm_mongodb --password=password mongo mongodb:27017
MongoDB Service added.
Service ID  : 6d7fbaa0-6b21-4c3f-a4a7-4be1e4f58b11
Service name: mongo
```

So the value of `ts-selector` would be: `{service_name="mongo"}` or `{service_id="6d7fbaa0-6b21-4c3f-a4a7-4be1e4f58b11"}`.
The same for `where` QAN filter: `service_name='mongo'` or `service_id='6d7fbaa0-6b21-4c3f-a4a7-4be1e4f58b11'`.
Note: On version 2 value of `ts-selector` would be: 
`{service_name="mongo"}` or `{service_id="/service_id/6d7fbaa0-6b21-4c3f-a4a7-4be1e4f58b11"}` 
and QAN filter: 
`service_name='mongo'` or `service_id='/service_id/6d7fbaa0-6b21-4c3f-a4a7-4be1e4f58b11'`.
Also, you can use `instance` option which filters QAN and core metrics by service name

```
> ./pmm-dump export --pmm-url="http://admin:admin@localhost:8282" --ts-selector=`{service_name="mongo"}` --dump-qan --where=`service_name='mongo'`
```
is same as
```
> ./pmm-dump export --pmm-url="http://admin:admin@localhost:8282" --instance="mongo" --dump-qan
```

To filter by multiple dashboards, you can use `dashboard` flag multiple times:
```
> ./pmm-dump export --pmm-url="http://admin:admin@localhost:8282" --dashboard='MongoDB Instances Overview' --dashboard='MySQL Instances Overview'`
```

In some cases you would need to override default configuration for VM/CH processing:

| Command | Flag                 | Description                                         | Example                                        |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| any     | victoria-metrics-url | URL of Victoria Metrics                             | `http://admin:admin@localhost:8282/prometheus` |
| any     | click-house-url      | URL of Click House                                  | `http://localhost:9000?database=pmm`           |
| export  | chunk-time-range     | Time range to be fit into a single chunk (VM only)  | `45s`, `5m`, `1h`                              |
| export  | chunk-rows           | Amount of rows to fit into a single chunk (CH only) | `1000`                                         |

### Encryption
By default pmm-dump encrypts everything using the AES-256-CTR algorithm and derives the key and IV from the passphrase using PBKDF2.
If a passphrase is not provided during export, one will be generated automatically.
To disable encryption, set the "no-encryption" flag for both export and import.
When exporting without the `no-encryption` flag, pmm-dump will add `.enc` to the filename of the dump. For example:
1. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz`, and the flag `no-encryption` is also set. The export will result in a non-encrypted `dump.tar.gz` file.
2. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz`, but the flag `no-encryption` is not set. The export will result in an encrypted `dump.tar.gz.enc` file.
3. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz.enc`, and the flag `no-encryption` is also set. The export will result in a non-encrypted `dump.tar.gz.enc` file.
4. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz.enc`, but the flag `no-encryption` is not set. The export will result in an encrypted `dump.tar.gz.enc.enc` file.

However, the file name will not be modified during import.  For example:
1. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz`, and the flag `no-encryption` is also set. The import will treat the file as if it's not encrypted.
2. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz`, and the flag `no-encryption` is not set.    The file will be imported as if it were encrypted.
3. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz.enc`, and the flag `no-encryption` is also set. The file will be imported as if it were not encrypted, even if the file name suggests otherwise.
4. The flag `dump-path` is set to `dump.tar.gz.enc`, and the flag `no-encryption` is not set. The file will be imported as if it were encrypted.

You must specify the password when importing an encrypted dump. Otherwise, an error will occur.
You can decrypt dump yourself using openssl with this command.
``` 
openssl enc -d -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -in dump.tar.gz.enc -out dump.tar.gz
```

### Using in pipelines
You can redirect output to STDOUT with --stdout option. It's useful to redirect output to another pmm-dump in a pipeline:
```
> ./pmm-dump export --pmm-url="http://admin:admin@localhost:8282" --dump-qan --stdout | ./pmm-dump import --pmm-url="http://admin:admin@localhost:8282" --dump-qan 
```

### Stop or postpone during export
You can set threshold values to stop or postpone pmm-dump during export using `max-load` and `critical-load` options.

The syntax for these options is following:

```
<threshold>=<percent_value>
```

You can provide multiple threshold values separated by commas. For example:

``` 
--max-load='CPU=100,RAM=30'
```
Available thresholds:
- `CPU` - CPU load of PMM instance in percents (0-100)
- `RAM` - RAM load of PMM instance in percents (0-100)
- `MYRAM` - RAM load of instance which uses pmm-dump in percents (0-100)

## About the dump file

Dump file is a `tar` archive compressed via `gzip`. Here is the shape of dump file:

* `dump.tar.gz/meta.json` - contains metadata about the dump (JSON object)
* `dump.tar.gz/vm/` - contains Victoria Metrics data chunks split by timeframe (in native VM format)
* `dump.tar.gz/ch/` - contains ClickHouse data chunks split by rows count (in TSV format)


## Using Makefile for local development environment

There is a Makefile that contains commands to build and test pmm-dump locally. It uses docker-compose to set up PMM Server, PMM Client and MongoDB.

You will need to have Go 1.21+ and Docker installed.
